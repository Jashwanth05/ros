Hello everyone, this project revolves around an Obstacle Avoidance Bot, incorporating key concepts such as Robot Operating System (ROS), Arduino programming, ROS serial Arduino, and Simple Vector Concepts.

Robot Operating System (ROS) stands as a versatile and robust framework extensively utilized in the development of intricate robotic systems. It furnishes a comprehensive array of tools, libraries, and conventions, streamlining the process of software creation and management for robots. ROS facilitates seamless communication among various components within a robotic system, encompassing sensors, actuators, and controllers, through a sophisticated publish-subscribe messaging system. Moreover, ROS offers functionalities spanning hardware abstraction, visualization, simulation, and distributed computing. Supporting multiple programming languages like C++ and Python, ROS boasts a rich ecosystem of packages tailored to diverse robotic applications.

Arduino programming is indispensable in the realm of embedded systems development and the control of hardware components using Arduino microcontrollers. With Arduino's open-source platform and intuitive integrated development environment (IDE), writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino boards becomes a streamlined process. Employing a variant of the C/C++ programming language tailored for the Arduino environment, Arduino programming is accessible to both novices and seasoned developers. Given the affordability, user-friendliness, and extensive community support, Arduino boards are a popular choice for robotics projects, facilitating prototyping and experimentation.

ROS serial Arduino serves as a pivotal ROS package facilitating seamless communication between ROS and Arduino boards, enabling users to interface with Arduino-based hardware within a ROS environment. Acting as a bridge between the ROS ecosystem and Arduino microcontrollers, ROS serial Arduino enables the seamless integration of Arduino sensors, actuators, and peripherals into ROS-enabled robotic systems. Leveraging a lightweight communication protocol over serial connections, ROS serial Arduino facilitates real-time data exchange between ROS nodes and Arduino sketches. This integration is particularly advantageous for incorporating Arduino-based functionalities into ROS projects, harnessing Arduino's versatility in robotic applications while capitalizing on ROS's advanced capabilities.

In the main working flow of the bot, ultrasonic sensors gather data on obstacle distances. These distance values are transmitted to the Arduino, which, utilizing Roserial Arduino, functions as a listener. In the publisher file, the values are processed in Python according to the algorithm outlined in algorithm.jpg. The Arduino then receives output from ROS and translates it into motor drive input, effectively controlling the motors.
